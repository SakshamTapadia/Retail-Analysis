# Retail Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of retail data using Python notebooks. The project aims to compare performance between two approaches: one that leverages the optimization library **FireDucks** and another that performs traditional data analysis without it. By using a base dataset of **500,000 records** and expanding it to **32 million records**, the project explores scalability and processing efficiency for large-scale retail data analysis.

## Project Objectives
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compare processing times and resource usage with and without FireDucks.
- **Scalability Analysis:** Investigate how data volume affects analysis performance.
- **Methodological Comparison:** Provide insights into the benefits and trade-offs of using optimization libraries for retail data processing.

## Repository Structure
- **`RetailAnalysis.ipynb`** - General analysis on the original dataset (500,000 records).
- **`RetailAnalysisUsingFireDucks.ipynb`** - Optimized analysis using FireDucks on the expanded dataset (32 million records).
- **`RetailAnalysiswithoutUsingFireDucks.ipynb`** - Comparative analysis performed without the FireDucks optimizations.
- **`requirements.txt`** - Lists all dependencies required to run the notebooks.
- **`.gitignore`** - Specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control.

## Dataset Details
- **Original Data:** Contains 500,000 records of retail transactions.
- **Expanded Data:** For performance testing, the original dataset is multiplied by a factor of **60**, resulting in **32 million records**.
- **Time-based Comparisons:** The notebooks analyze and compare processing times across different data volumes to highlight performance differences.

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/retail-analysis.git
cd retail-analysis
```

### Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash

```
Open the desired notebook to start the analysis.

## Project Insights
- **Optimized Processing:** The use of FireDucks demonstrates significant improvements in processing times for large datasets.
- **Scalability Testing:** Expanding the dataset provides a realistic scenario for testing performance under high data volumes.
- **Comparative Analysis:** The notebooks serve as a practical guide for understanding different data processing techniques and their impacts on performance.
